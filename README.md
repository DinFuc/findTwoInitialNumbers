# findTwoInitialNumbers
Recently you have received two positive integer numbers x and y. You forgot them, but you remembered a shuffled list containing all divisors of x (including 1 and x) and all divisors of y(including 1 and y). If z is a divisor of both numbers x and y at the same time, there are two occurrences of z in the list.

For example, if x=4 and y=6 then the given list can be any permutation of the list [1,2,4,1,2,3,6]. Some of the possible lists are: [1,1,2,4,6,3,2], [4,6,1,1,2,3,2] or [1,6,3,2,4,1,2].

Your problem is to restore suitable positive integer numbers x and y that would yield the same list of divisors (possibly in different order).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists, i.e. the given list of divisors corresponds to some positive integers x and y.
